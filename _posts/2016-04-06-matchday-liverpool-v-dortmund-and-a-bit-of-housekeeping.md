#### Liverpool v Dortmund, Europa League Quarterfinal 1st Leg

The Klopp Derby kicks off at 1:05 pm tomorrow! It's the quarterfinal of the Europa League and Liverpool are taking on Borussia Dortmund at the Westfalenstadion. It should be an incredible atmosphere at the match, and at the Abbey as well. We'll see you there for lunch!

#### Housekeeping Note

It's come to our attention that there was an incident at the Tottenham match this past weekend where one of our own supporters attempted to take an item off of the Abbey's wall. This is obviously unacceptable.

We've been lucky enough to have the Abbey as a dedicated Liverpool bar for 2 years now, and Glen and the staff have been nothing but wonderful to us and our club. In our five years of existence, this is the first time that I've ever had something like this reported to me, and it should be the last time that something like this happens.

To the person that did this - it's great that you're a Liverpool fan, but don't come back to the Abbey, your support is not needed there.

If we have one guiding principle here at LFC Denver, it's pretty simply 'don't be an asshole'. To anyone who can't abide by that, please find somewhere else to watch the matches.

To everyone else - thank you for your continued support of Liverpool and LFC Denver. You all have been fantastic and I sincerely look forward to watching as many matches as I can with you.

YNWA,  
Eben

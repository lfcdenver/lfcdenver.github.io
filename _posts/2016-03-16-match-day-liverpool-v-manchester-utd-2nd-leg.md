We're looking to make our way into the Europa League Quarterfinals following our 2-0 victory in the first leg v Manchester United. Match starts at **2pm** tomorrow, and the Abbey will be open and running specials for St. Patrick's Day. $4 Bud Lights and $4 Stella Cidre, along with all of the usual monthly specials. See you there!

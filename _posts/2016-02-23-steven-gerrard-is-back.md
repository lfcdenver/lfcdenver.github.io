Steven Gerrard and the LA Galaxy will be in town to take on the Colorado Rapids on Saturday March 12. The Rapids have been kind enough to set aside tickets in Section 103 for any LFC Denver supporters who would like to attend what is likely one of Stevie's final matches in Denver.

Tickets can be purchased at [www.rapidstix.com/lfcdenver](http://www.rapidstix.com/lfcdenver).

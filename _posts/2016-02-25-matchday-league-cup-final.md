The League Cup Final v Manchester City is this **Sunday at 9:30**! LFC Denver will have giveaways from **[Breckenridge Brewery](http://www.breckbrew.com)** starting at 9 and we'll be giving away our 4th and final LFC shirt of the season after the match.

**[Anfield Shop](http://www.anfieldshop.com)** was also kind enough to donate some items that we will be drawing for as well.

It's sure to be a packed house, so make sure to get to the Abbey Tavern early if you want a seat!
